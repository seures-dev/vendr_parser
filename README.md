Collect all products from the website https://www.vendr.com/ :
● Collect products from only three categories: DevOps, IT Infrastructure, Data Analytics
and Management
● The following data should be collected: product name, category, price range, and
description (refer to the attached photo).
● The scraping must be implemented with requests for fetching data and lxml for parsing.
● Implement a task queue specifically for managing the product scraping tasks. Each
thread should take a task (i.e., a product to scrape) from the queue and process it.
● Use multithreading in your implementation, with multiple threads fetching product data
from the queue and one dedicated thread writing the collected data to the database in
parallel.
● Ensure that all scraping results are stored in the database
